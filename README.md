# madlibs_game_in_python
# Project Overview
This project is a simple Python-based Mad Libs game that generates a fun and dynamic short story based on user input.
The program asks the user to enter different types of words (such as adjectives, verbs, animals, places, and emotions).
Once all inputs are provided, the program inserts them into a predefined story template and prints a unique story every time.
This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts, user interaction, and string formatting.

# What Is Happening in This Project?
The program prompts the user to enter:
   * Adjectives
   * Verbs
   * An animal
   * A place
   * An object
   * An emotion
All user inputs are stored in variables.
A story template is created using f-strings.
The final story is printed to the console using the user’s inputs.
Each time the program runs, the story changes depending on what the user enters.

# Theories & Concepts Used
   * User Input (input())
   * Variables
   * String Formatting (f-strings)
   * Sequential Program Flow
